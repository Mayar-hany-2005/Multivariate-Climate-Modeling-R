## 📌 Project Overview
A comprehensive study spanning nearly five years (January 2020 - May 2024), aimed at analyzing global climate dynamics. This project integrates traditional meteorological metrics with critical environmental indicators like **CO2 concentrations**, **PM2.5 levels**, and **Urbanization Indices** to provide a holistic view of human-climate interaction.

## 🔍 Deep Dive: Dataset & Methodology
The analysis was built on a multidimensional data dictionary:
* **Temporal & Spatial Metadata:** Analysis of Year, Month, Latitude, and Altitude to capture geospatial trends.
* **Environmental Metrics:** Monitoring CO2 (PPM) and PM2.5 to assess air quality impact on temperature.
* **Atmospheric Variables:** Detailed study of Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, and Precipitation.

## 🚀 Key Technical Features
* **Multivariate Modeling:** Used Multiple Regression to isolate the effects of environmental pollutants on global temperatures.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Created ~35 visualizations including Ridge plots for seasonal variance and Correlation Heatmaps.
* **Geographic Sensitivity:** Identified that including Latitude and Altitude improved model predictive power by **39.5%**.
* **Advanced Statistics:** Applied **MANOVA** and Z-score standardization to identify significant seasonal deviations.

## 📊 Critical Findings (From Technical Report)
* **The Southern Hemisphere Insight:** Confirmed an "Inverted Climate Profile" where Summer showed strong negative temperature deviations (-1.39 Z-score), suggesting the data originates from the Southern Hemisphere.
* **The Humidity Anomaly:** Spring was statistically identified as the most humid season (+1.01 Z-score spike), distinct from all other periods.
* **Pollution-Climate Link:** A strong correlation was found between Urbanization Indices and PM2.5 levels, directly impacting local atmospheric stability.

## 🤖 Model Performance
* **Best Fit:** Linear Regression emerged as the top-performing model with an **R² of 0.39**.
* **Stability:** Multiple Regression models maintained a consistent R² around 0.204 across various environmental subsets.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
