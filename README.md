## 📌 Project Overview
This study utilizes a comprehensive dataset (2020-2024) to analyze global climate dynamics. The project integrates traditional weather metrics (temperature, precipitation) with critical environmental indicators like CO2 concentrations and PM2.5 levels to investigate the interaction between human activity and climate patterns.

## 🚀 Key Features & Analysis
* **Multivariate Modeling:** Implementation of Multiple Regression and Multivariate Analysis to predict environmental shifts.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Over 35 high-quality visualizations created using `ggplot2` to uncover hidden climate trends.ipynb].
* **Geographic Insights:** Analysis of latitude and altitude impacts, showing a **39.5% improvement** in model accuracy when including geographic features.
* **Advanced Statistics:** Applied MANOVA and Z-score standardization to compare relative intensity across seasons.ipynb].

## 📊 Critical Insights
* **Inverted Climate Profile:** Analysis confirmed an "inverted" pattern (Cold Summer / Warm Winter) in specific regions, strongly suggesting Southern Hemisphere dynamics.
* **Best Model:** Our Linear Regression model achieved an **R² of 0.39**, providing a robust baseline for climate prediction.
* **Humidity Anomaly:** Spring was identified as a distinct period with a significant spike in humidity levels compared to other seasons.
